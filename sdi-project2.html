    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<article>
<p>For this project I wrote a story based on the theme of my cat's life. It isn't exactly the most thrilling story, but i found it more functional to create a new story from scratch and just write it based on the flow chart rather then continue with my theme from project 1.</p>
<p>For what it is worth, I do actually have an extremely fat cat (13 pounds). The story is pretty accurate in describing my cat's day to day activities.</p>
